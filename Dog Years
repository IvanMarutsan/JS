/*In this project, I have practiced variables and strings in JavaScript.

Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. 
We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. 
In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. 
How old would you be if you were a dog?*/

let myAge = 26;
//That is my age
let earlyYears = 2;
//Early years
earlyYears *= 10.5;
myAge -= 2;
let laterYears = myAge;
//Later years
laterYears *= 4;
//Dogs years accounted for by my later years
//console.log(`${earlyYears}+${laterYears}`);
let myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;
//My real age in dogs age
let myName = "Ivan".toLowerCase();
//Returns a string with all lowercase letters.
console.log(
  `My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`
);
//My name and my dog age
