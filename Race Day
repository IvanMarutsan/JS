/*Designed the logic for an app that gives runners information on race day!

The program registers runners for the race and gives them instructions on race day.
Hereâ€™s how our registration works. 
There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). 
They can register early or late. 
Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

Race number:
Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
All others receive a number below 1000.

Start time:
Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
Early adults run at 9:30 am.
Late adults run at 11:00 am.
Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).*/

let raceNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);
let earlyRegistered = false;
let age = 18;

if (age > 18 && earlyRegistered === true) {
  raceNumber += 1000;
  console.log(`The race ${raceNumber} starts at 9:30 am`);
} else if (age > 18 && earlyRegistered === false) {
  raceNumber += 1000;
  console.log(`The race  ${raceNumber}, starts at 11:00 am`);
} else if (age < 18) {
  raceNumber += 1000;
  console.log(`The race  ${raceNumber} starts at 12:30 am`);
} else {
  console.log("See the registration desk");
}
